## WorkoutSpot

WorkoutSpot is an app to get statistics about a point or segment of a workout in HealthKit. 
For a given point in a workout, view: location on a map, time, distance, altitude, grade, calculated speed, and heart rate, if available.
For a given segment of a workout, view: route on a map, duration, distance, climb distance, average grade, average calculated speed, and average heart rate, if available.

Visualize the calculated speed, altitude, and heart rate with a graph over a segment. 
Change the segment selection by zooming and scrolling on the graph.
