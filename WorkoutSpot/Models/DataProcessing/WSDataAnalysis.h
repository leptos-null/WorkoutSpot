/// Data Analysis provides a model to store and process
///   data points. The data is indexed by @c keys which
///   may represent indicies, or a relation to another
///   value such as time.
/// @discussion
/// An example may be altitude of an aircraft as @c data
///   and distance traveled as the @c keys (indicating
///   distance is the domain). The maximum would tell
///   you the highest the aircraft was. The minimum
///   would tell you the lowest the aircraft was.
///   If you take the derivative of this data, you get
///   the grade the aircraft was traveling on. The
///   maximum of the grade would tell you the steepest
///   grade at which the aircraft was climbing.
